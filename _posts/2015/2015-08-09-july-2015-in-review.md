---

Following [Vipul Naik](http://vipulnaik.com)'s, [Peter
Hurford](http://peterhurford.com)'s[^1] and others' example, I will be
publishing reviews of my activities as blog posts on a monthly basis.  This
will help me track progress, compare against goals set in the past and try to
measure overall impact.

For the most part, July was kind of a slow month because of the house
remodeling being done at home, which probably will be finished in the next
couple of weeks.

## ASP.NET 5 & ASPNET5CO ###############################################

[ASPNET5CO]({{ site.url }}/aspnet5co) is a project that comprises my efforts to
socially and technically advocate the [ASP.NET 5 software
framework](https://www.asp.net/vnext). This month I worked on the following:

- Wrote new sections including:
  - [The .NET Framework and its future][]
  - [Cross-platform development with .NET][]
  - [Introduction to ASP.NET 5][]
  - [ASP.NET 5 community][]
  - [DNX, DNVM and DNU][]
  - [Installation guide][]
  - [Development guide][]
  - [Documentation guide][]
- Created a [Dockerfile](https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }}/aspnet5co/blob/master/Dockerfile) for development on Linux with [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/).
- Improved the organization and presentation of the website.

[The .NET Framework and its future]: {{ site.url }}/aspnet5co/dotnet-framework-and-future/
[Cross-platform development with .NET]: {{ site.url }}/aspnet5co/dotnet-cross-platform-development/
[Introduction to ASP.NET 5]: {{ site.url }}/aspnet5co/aspnet5-introduction/
[ASP.NET 5 community]: {{ site.url }}/aspnet5co/aspnet5-community

## Android development and debugging ###################################

I did some Android development and debugging in order to troubleshoot an
application a friend is developing. Because of the way his application is
designed, it needs root/admin permissions to access some features of the
device.

I don't normally use a custom ROM neither do I root my device[^3], but on this
occasion I temporarily installed Cyanogenmod on my Nexus 4 and obtained root
permissions on the phone. The result of this is a [guide to set up a debugging and development environment for Android on Linux](https://gist.github.com/{{ site.github_username }}/dd2eb3512ac225d0ad0e).

## Folding@Home Client as a systemd service unit #######################

I fold on a regular basis on my desktop computer and my home server, both of
which are running Fedora (see stats [here][fah-stats0] and [here][fah-stats1]).
[Systemd][] keeps gaining popularity among the major Linux distributions
including Fedora, Ubuntu, Debian and ArchLinux, but Folding@Home packages still
haven't shipped with systemd support.

I created a [systemd service unit file][] and a [short guide to install it and
use it][fahclient-systemd]. This makes it possible to control the Folding@Home
client as a regular systemd service unit.

## Dotfiles repository #################################################

I started a [dotfiles repository][] at Github. I think one of the main reasons
people maintain a personal dotfiles repository is to be able to easily
synchronize their configuration files and directories across different
hosts/machines. I haven't had this need since I synchronize my files with
*Unison*/*rsync* over *SSH* without using third-party services and also because
I keep individual configurations as [gists][].

However it seems that it would be easier to maintain all configurations in a
single Github repository as opposed to keeping each configuration as a separate
Gist repository. Moreover, having all configuration files and directories
together makes sharing and browsing easier.

[gists]: https://gist.github.com/{{ site.github_username }}

## Philanthropy/EA #####################################################

As suggested by [Tom Ash](http://tog22.tumblr.com/) of [Charity
Science](http://www.charityscience.com), I'll be helping with the local
*Effective Altruism* presence here at Monterrey. The point of this is to have
at least one person other people interested in EA could talk to[^2]. Be sure to
contact me if you want to know more about effective altruism related ideas.

A mailing list and a [Facebook
group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/739984722775452/) were set up, although
for the time being we may organize all Spanish-speaking EAs in a single group
instead, probably *[Altruismo
Eficaz](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1605543996325148/)*.

*Folding@Home* from June 15 to July 15, I scored 8,036 points and folded 17
work-units. [Here's]({{ site.url }}/{{ site.images_dir }}/2015/07/folding_at_home_stats_july_2015.png)
a graph of total daily production history for July.

Finally, I made [GiveWell](http://www.givewell.org/) my chosen charity at
[Amazon Smile](https://smile.amazon.com/).

## Other ###############################################################

I performed minor improvements to the presentation and layout of my projects/repos at Github and at this website. See [Projects]({{ site.url }}/projects) and my [Github repos](https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }}/?tab=repositories).

[^1]: Peter Hurford posts his reviews on a quarterly basis instead.
[^2]: This didn't really happened in July but in March, but I figured it's the kind of activity I should include in my personal reviews.
[^3]: I don't usually require admin permissions and I feel rooting my main phone might inadvertently introduce security vulnerabilities to the system.
