## Philanthropy #######################################################

In the [previous monthly review post][apr-review] I forgot to include a small
donation I made to the [Against Malaria Foundation][] to help with their [Just
One Net][] fundraiser campaign.  More than 400 people participated and together
they raised $16,000, which is enough to buy more than 5000 nets. The campaign
ended on April 25, which is [World Malaria
Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Malaria_Day "World Malaria Day at
Wikipedia")

[Folding@Home during May][fah-stats] I scored TODO points, completed TODO work
units and ranked 46th out of all the members of [The Longevity Meme team][].
My total score is TODO at the time of this writing.  A graph of total daily
production history during May can be found [here][fah-apr-graph].
