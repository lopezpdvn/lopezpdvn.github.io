Following the example by [Vipul Naik](http://vipulnaik.com) and [Peter
Hurford](http://peterhurford.com)[^1], I will be publishing reviews of my
activities as blog posts on a monthly basis.  This will help me track progress,
compare against goals setted in the past and measure overall impact.

- Did some Android freelance consulting
- [How to set up a debugging and development environment for Android on
  Linux]()
- [Install Folding@home FAHClient on Linux as a systemd service unit]()
- Created a dotfiles repo, instead of individually managing configuration files
  as secret gists. Also because to synchronize my configuration files and
  directories I usually just use unison and rsync.
- Prof. Aida Gonzalez, my project advisor has approved completion of the
  [ASPNET5CO project]().

[^1]: Peter Hurford posts his reviews on a quarterly basis instead.
