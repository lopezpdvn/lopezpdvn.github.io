## Philanthropy #######################################################

[Folding@Home during december][fah-stats] I scored 30,021 points, completed 57
work units and ranked 47th out of all the members of [The Longevity Meme
team][].  My total score is 1,098,758 overall.  A graph of total daily
production history during december can be found [here][fah-dec-graph].

While trying to make a donation to the [Brain Preservation Foundation][] I ran
into some problems that apparently prevented the donation from being accepted,
at least temporarily. Donations to the Brain Preservation Foundation are
processed by [JustGive][], a "nonprofit organization whose mission is to
increase charitable giving by connecting people with the charities and causes
they care most about.".

Unfortunately, it seems that JustGive's website doesn't allow international
donors to input their billing addresses to exactly match their bank records. I
will follow up on this situation with the Brain Preservation Foundation and
JustGive.
