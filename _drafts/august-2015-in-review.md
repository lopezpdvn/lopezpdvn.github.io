Now that most of the house remodelling at home is done, I have been moving back
all my stuff to my bedroom. The work being done has made some of my things very
dusty so before moving them back to the bedroom I had to thoroughly clean them.
Starting the last week of August I'm again working full-time on my workstation
and it really is great to be back with full productivity.

- Started to process paperwork at UANL in order to get my Master of Engineering
  Degree, in Information Engineering.

- I finally got around playing with [Node.js][]. I'm currently using the
  synchronous version of the API for system administration scripts. One of my
  goals with Node.js is to replace all of my UNIX shell and (some of my) Python
  scripts for sysadmin work with Node.js scripts. I'm currently keeping the
  scripts in the public repo [nodejsplay][].

- Inspired by the [Rule of Separation][] in Eric S. Raymond's book [The Art of
  Unix Programming][], I created the project [Syspol][] (*Sys*tem *Pol*icy).

## ASPNET5CO

*Problems* repo, with multiproject solution on VS2015, main project targetting
`dotnet` framework and test project as a DNX project.

## Philanthropy

I made a small donation to the [Machine Intelligence Research Institute][] to
help with their [Summer Fundraiser][]. At the time of this writing the
fundraiser had already ended.
