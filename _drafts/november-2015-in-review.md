[Folding@Home during November][fah-stats] I scored 28,114 points, completed 53
work units and ranked 47th of all the members of [The Longevity Meme team][],
overtaking fellow folder [BrentErskine][].  A graph of total daily production
history for November can be found [here][fah-nov-graph]. Also during this month
I reached 1 million points total.

I made a small donation to the [SENS Research Foundation][] to help with their
[end of year fundraiser][fundraiser]. Currently the numbers look good and it
seems likely they will reach the $125,000 goal.
