      It's my main internet nickname that I use on some sites. The "word"

      in my name (Pedro I. Lopez).

      As of 2016, just two:

      - This one, my main personal website
        [http://pedroivanlopez.com](http://pedroivanlopez.com), with both
        [http://lopezpedro.net](http://lopezpedro.net) and
        [http://pedroilopez.com](http://pedroilopez.com) pointing to it.
      - My old personal website [http://dreilopz.com](http://dreilopz.com) for
        historical purposes.
