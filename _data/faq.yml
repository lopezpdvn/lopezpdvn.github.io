- q: When did you start using the GNU/Linux operating system?
  a: |
      In late 2008, the first GNU/Linux distribution I installed and used was
      Fedora 9.

- q: How is your name pronounced?
  a: |
      Short answer:  /'pɛdrɔ ˈaɪ vən ˈlɔpɛs/

      Long answer: Don't worry too much about it, if you speak functional
          English, you are likely to pronounce it in an acceptable manner. I'm
          OK with both the English (/'pɛdrɔ ˈaɪ vən ˈlɔpɛs/) and Spanish
          (/'pɛdrɔ iˈvɑːn ˈlɔpɛs/) pronunciations.

- q: What does *dreilopz* mean?
  a: |
      It's my main internet nickname that I use on some sites. The "word"
      *dreilopz* is just a pronounceable permutation of the set of characters
      in my name (Pedro I. Lopez).

- q: What websites do you maintain?
  a: |
      As of 2016, just two:

      - This one, my main personal website
        [http://pedroivanlopez.com](http://pedroivanlopez.com), with both
        [http://lopezpedro.net](http://lopezpedro.net) and
        [http://pedroilopez.com](http://pedroilopez.com) redirecting to it.
      - My old personal website [http://dreilopz.com](http://dreilopz.com) for
        historical purposes.

- q: When did you start being a vegetarian?
  a: In September 2011.

- q: Why are you a vegetarian?
  a: |
      In short, because it's ethically efficient. A great body of robust
      evidence points out that the more vegan one is, the better society is as
      a whole.  Reducing the consumption of animal products prevents bad stuff
      from happening while providing concrete benefits to sentient beings in
      the present and the future. It also has the potential of inspiring others
      to care more about moral progress.

- q: What happened to the music videos on your YouTube channel?
  a: |
      I removed some pre-2013 recordings of me playing covers and original
      songs on the guitar and bass from my [YouTube
      channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/dreilopz). I no longer feel
      comfortable with the quality of such material and I look forward to
      recording and posting new videos. Also, I may commercialize some of the
      original stuff, so I think it's best to keep it private.

- q: Why do you use your middle name?
  a: |
      In short, because I think it's a good choice for optimizing
      recognizability.

      I don't use *Pedro López* because it is one of the most common names in
      México and probably of all the Hispanic world. Also, there are several
      famous people already with that name. In the past, I used *Pedro I.
      López* for a while.

      After doing a few web searches with several combinations of my names, it
      seems that Pedro Ivan Lopez has the best chance of showing top results
      related to me. As mentioned in [this
      question](#what-websites-do-you-maintain), I own several domains with my
      name on them, all of them redirecting to this website.

      Honestly, I don't feel entirely sure about all of this, and I don't have
      a particular attachment to any names, but I am trying to optimize
      recognizability. I may change my opinion on this in the future. By the
      way, my full name is Pedro Iván López Hernández.

- q: What are your favorite music genres?
  a: |
      At heart, I'm a rhythm kind of guy, so I tend to listen more to metal
      (progressive, tech, death, etc.), EDM and some jazz/fusion too. I also
      enjoy ambient and film music among other genres. See page
      [music](../music).

- q: Do you play any musical instruments?
  a: Yes, I play guitar and bass guitar. See page [music](../music).

- q: What are your favorite TV/film genres?
  a: |
      Comedy is my favorite TV/film genre, particularly sitcoms and stand up. I
      do watch a lot of other stuff, though.

- q: Why are you public about your giving?
  a: |
      Because I want to inspire and encourage people to give effectively, and
      help develop a culture of giving. Research shows that when people know
      that others are giving, they are themselves more likely to give.
      Socially, there may be a small price to pay if it's regarded as boasting,
      but I think the benefits outweigh it. See [To Inspire People to Give, Be Public About Your Giving](http://effective-altruism.com/ea/7q/to_inspire_people_to_give_be_public_about_your/ "To Inspire People to Give, Be Public About Your Giving") by
      [Peter Hurford](http://peterhurford.com "Peter Hurford's website") at
      [Effective Altruism Forum](http://effective-altruism.com/ "Effective Altruism Forum")

      Also, it signals my true interests; I like the saying "Put your money
      where your mouth is."
