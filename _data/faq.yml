- q: When did you start using the GNU/Linux operating system?
  a: |
      In late 2008, the first GNU/Linux distribution I installed and used was
      Fedora 9.

- q: What does *dreilopz* mean?
  a: |
      It's my main internet nickname that I use on some sites. The "word"
      *dreilopz* is just a pronounceable permutation of the set of characters
      in my name (Pedro I. Lopez).

- q: What websites do you maintain?
  a: |
      As of 2016, just two:

      - This one, my main personal website
        [http://pedroivanlopez.com](http://pedroivanlopez.com), with both
        [http://lopezpedro.net](http://lopezpedro.net) and
        [http://pedroilopez.com](http://pedroilopez.com) redirecting to it.
      - My old personal website [http://dreilopz.com](http://dreilopz.com) for
        historical purposes.

- q: When did you start being a vegetarian?
  a: In September 2011.

- q: Why do you use your middle name?
  a: |
      Because currently, I think it's a good choice for optimizing for
      recognizability.

      I don't use *Pedro López* because it is one of the most common names in
      México and probably of all the Hispanic world. Also, there are several
      famous people already with that name. In the past, I used *Pedro I.
      López* for a while.

      After doing a few web searches with several combinations of my names, it
      seems that Pedro Ivan Lopez has the best shot of showing results related
      to me. As mentioned in [this question](#what-websites-do-you-maintain), I
      own several domains with my name in it, all of them redirecting to this
      website.

      I should mention that I'm not really sure about all of this, and I don't
      have a particular attachment to any names but I am trying to optimize for
      recognizability. I may change my opinion about this in the future. By the
      way, my whole name is Pedro Iván López Hernández
