- q: When did you start using the GNU/Linux operating system?
  a: |
      In late 2008, the first GNU/Linux distribution I installed and used was
      Fedora 9.

- q: What does *dreilopz* mean?
  a: |
      It's my main internet nickname that I use on some sites. The "word"
      *dreilopz* is just a pronounceable permutation of the set of characters
      in my name (Pedro I. Lopez).

- q: What websites do you maintain?
  a: |
      As of 2016, just two:

      - This one, my main personal website
        [http://pedroivanlopez.com](http://pedroivanlopez.com), with both
        [http://lopezpedro.net](http://lopezpedro.net) and
        [http://pedroilopez.com](http://pedroilopez.com) redirecting to it.
      - My old personal website [http://dreilopz.com](http://dreilopz.com) for
        historical purposes.

- q: When did you start being a vegetarian?
  a: In September 2011.

- q: What happened to the music videos on your YouTube channel?
  a: |
      I removed some pre-2013 recordings of me playing covers and original
      songs on the guitar and bass from my [YouTube
      channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/dreilopz). I no longer feel
      comfortable with the quality of such material and I look forward to
      recording and posting new videos. Also, I may commercialize some of the
      original stuff, so I think it’s best to keep it private.

- q: Why do you use your middle name?
  a: |
      In short, because I think it's a good choice for optimizing for
      recognizability.

      I don't use *Pedro López* because it is one of the most common names in
      México and probably of all the Hispanic world. Also, there are several
      famous people already with that name. In the past, I used *Pedro I.
      López* for a while.

      After doing a few web searches with several combinations of my names, it
      seems that Pedro Ivan Lopez has the best shot of showing top results
      related to me. As mentioned in [this
      question](#what-websites-do-you-maintain), I own several domains with my
      name on it, all of them redirecting to this website.

      Honestly, I don't feel entirely sure about all of this, and I don’t have
      a particular attachment to any names, but I am trying to optimize for
      recognizability. I may change my opinion on this in the future. By the
      way, my full name is Pedro Iván López Hernández.

- q: What are you favorite music genres?
  a: |
      At heart, I’m kind of a rhythm guy, so I tend to listen more to metal
      (progressive, tech, death, etc.), EDM and some jazz/fusion too. I also
      enjoy ambient and film music among other genres. See page
      [music](../music).

- q: What are you favorite TV/film genres?
  a: |
      Comedy is my favorite TV/film genre, particularly sitcoms and stand up. I
      do watch a lot of other stuff, though.
