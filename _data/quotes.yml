      The question (determining whether animals deserve ethical consideration)
      is not 'Can they reason?' nor 'Can they talk?' but 'Can they suffer?'

  quote: |
      The total amount of suffering per year in the natural world is beyond all
      decent contemplation. During the minute it takes me to compose this
      sentence, thousands of animals are being eaten alive; others are running
      for their lives, whimpering with fear; others are being slowly devoured
      from within by rasping parasites; thousands of all kinds are dying of
      starvation, thirst and disease. [...] The universe we observe has
      precisely the properties we should expect if there is, at bottom, no
      design, no purpose, no evil and no good, nothing but blind, pitiless
      indifference.
