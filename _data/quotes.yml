      The total amount of suffering per year in the natural world is beyond all
      decent contemplation. During the minute it takes me to compose this
      sentence, thousands of animals are being eaten alive; others are running
      for their lives, whimpering with fear; others are being slowly devoured
      from within by rasping parasites; thousands of all kinds are dying of
      starvation, thirst and disease. [...] The universe we observe has
      precisely the properties we should expect if there is, at bottom, no
      design, no purpose, no evil and no good, nothing but blind, pitiless
      indifference.

    I was walking along the bank of a stream when I saw a mother otter with her
    cubs, a very endearing sight, I'm sure you'll agree. And even as I watched,
    the mother otter dived into the water and came up with a plump salmon,
    which she subdued and dragged onto a half submerged log. As she ate it,
    while of course it was still alive, the body split and I remember to this
    day the sweet pinkness of its roes as they spilled out, much to the delight
    of the baby otters, who scrambled over themselves to feed on the delicacy.
    One of nature's wonders, gentlemen. Mother and children dining upon mother
    and children. And that is when I first learned about evil. It is built into
    the very nature of the universe. Every world spins in pain. If there is any
    kind of supreme being, I told myself, it is up to all of us to become his
    moral superior.
