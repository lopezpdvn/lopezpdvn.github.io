  quote: |
      The total amount of suffering per year in the natural world is beyond all
      decent contemplation. During the minute it takes me to compose this
      sentence, thousands of animals are being eaten alive; others are running
      for their lives, whimpering with fear; others are being slowly devoured
      from within by rasping parasites; thousands of all kinds are dying of
      starvation, thirst and disease. [...] The universe we observe has
      precisely the properties we should expect if there is, at bottom, no
      design, no purpose, no evil and no good, nothing but blind, pitiless
      indifference.

      As a cryptography and computer security expert, I have never understood
      the current fuss about the open source software movement. In the
      cryptography world, we consider open source necessary for good security;
      we have for decades. Public security is always more secure than
      proprietary security. It's true for cryptographic algorithms, security
      protocols, and security source code. For us, open source isn't just a
      business model; it's smart engineering practice.

      measure it, when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a
      meagre and unsatisfactory kind; it may be the beginning of knowledge, but
      you have scarcely, in your thoughts, advanced to the stage of science,
      whatever the matter may be.
