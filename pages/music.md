## About

Music is one of my main interests. At heart, I'm a rhythm kind of guy, so I tend
to listen more to metal (progressive, tech, death, etc.), EDM and some
jazz/fusion too.  I also enjoy ambient and film music among other genres.

Most of my involvement in music has been passive, meaning listening to music
and thinking about it. But I also play a few instruments, mostly bass, and some
guitar too. I was a member of the power/heavy metal band
[HeavenForce](https://www.facebook.com/pages/HeavenForce/112496182123196), and
I recorded the bass guitar for their release *In The Gates of Space*.

I initially wanted to play drums, but after realizing that I wouldn't be able
to purchase a drum kit in the near future as a teenager without a lot of money,
I bought a cheap electric guitar which I still own, a Yamaha Pacifica 112.
After a few years of playing the guitar, I borrowed a bass guitar from a friend
and switched to it almost entirely. Then I bought an _Ibanez GSR180_ bass
guitar which is my primary instrument since then.
