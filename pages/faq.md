# 1. When did you start using the GNU/Linux operating system?

In late 2008, the first GNU/Linux distribution I installed and used was Fedora 9.

# 2. When did you start being a vegetarian?

In September 2011.

# 3. What does *dreilopz* mean?

It's my main internet nickname that I use on some sites. The "word" *dreilopz*
is just a pronounceable permutation of the set of characters in my name (Pedro
I. Lopez).

# 4. What websites do you maintain?

As of 2016, just two:

- This one, my main personal website
  [http://pedroivanlopez.com](http://pedroivanlopez.com), with both
  [http://lopezpedro.net](http://lopezpedro.net) and
  [http://pedroilopez.com](http://pedroilopez.com) pointing to it.
- My old personal website [http://dreilopz.com](http://dreilopz.com) for
  historical purposes.
