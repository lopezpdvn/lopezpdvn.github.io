## Effective Altruism

[Effective altruism](http://www.effectivealtruism.org "Effective Altruism") is
a philosophy and social movement which applies evidence and reason to
determining the most effective ways to improve the world.

## Donations

In 2015 I have financially supported the following organizations:

- [Machine Intelligence Research Institute](https://intelligence.org "Machine Intelligence Research Institute")
- [SENS Research Foundation](http://sens.org "SENS Research Foundation").

For other effective charities to support please see [Top
Charities](http://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities "Top Charities @ GiveWell")

## Volunteer Computing

Volunteer computing is a type of distributed computing in which computer owners
donate their computing resources (such as processing power and storage) to one
or more projects. Please the see the
[Volunteer Computing Page]({{ site.baseurl }}/volunteer-computing "Volunteer Computing Page").

## Reducing meat and dairy consumption

Eating less meat and dairy is an easy and effective way to help society. The
[Reducetarian website](http://www.reducetarian.com "Reducetarian") is a good
place to start.

> The Reducetarian Foundation develops unique education and research programs
> to reduce the amount of meat that our society consumes, thereby improving
> human health, protecting the environment, and saving farm animals.
