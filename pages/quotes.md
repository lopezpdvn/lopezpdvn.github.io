- My country is the world, and my religion is to do good.

  --Thomas Paine, The Rights of Man, 1791.

- The question [determining whether animals deserve ethical consideration] is
  not 'Can they reason?' nor 'Can they talk?' but 'Can they suffer?'

  --Jeremy Bentham, 1789

- The total amount of suffering per year in the natural world is beyond all
  decent contemplation. During the minute it takes me to compose this sentence,
  thousands of animals are being eaten alive; others are running for their
  lives, whimpering with fear; others are being slowly devoured from within by
  rasping parasites; thousands of all kinds are dying of starvation, thirst and
  disease. [...] The universe we observe has precisely the properties we should
  expect if there is, at bottom, no design, no purpose, no evil and no good,
  nothing but blind, pitiless indifference.
  
  --Richard Dawkins, 1995, "River Out of Eden," pp. 131-33
