## Backups and mirrors

Usually is not essential to backup the folder `%USERPROFILE%\AppData`.
Exceptions are

- You wish to backup not only user data but system state too. However, in this
  case, you should consider using [system
  images](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/what-is-a-system-image).
