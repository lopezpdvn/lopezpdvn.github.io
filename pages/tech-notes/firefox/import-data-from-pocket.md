Let x be the path to a Pocket export HTML file. Optionally edit x so you export
archived/read pocket entries.

Show all Bookmarks on Firefox, and click on *Bookmarks Menu* on the tree on the
left pane. The imported data form Pocket always creates the bookmarks in this
location, so you may want to clean it up before importing so you can be sure
what has been imported and what was there before.
