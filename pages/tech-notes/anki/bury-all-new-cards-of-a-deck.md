This has to be done manually. Click on the deck, and then on *Custom study*.
Select *Study by card state or tag*, then *New cards only* and select a number
of cards sufficiently large to pull all new cards from the deck. Click on
*Choose tags*. In the *Selective Study* window, select tags if needed, then
click on *OK*.

A new *Custom Study Session* deck is created. Start studying, and bury every
card when shown. You can do this quickly by pressing the `-` key repeatedly.
Then delete the *Custom Study Session* deck.
